# Hack Your Headphones #

https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/hack-your-headphones

![Image](hackheadphones.png)

This project is related to mine because of the intention to create sound in an interesting way using the Micro:Bit. In this experiment there is the similar usage of crocodile clips and a headset that my Banana Keyboard project has. Except that in my final product, I decided to swap out the headphones for a piezo buzzer, so that the sound from the Micro:Bit could be heard in the YouTube video that I uploaded. Otherwise this experiment is pretty much my project, without the banana and orange added as triggers for sound to be made.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before:* before reading **The Design of Everyday Things** I had the belief that affordances were clear things that were the advertised purpose of an object, for example, the advertised affordance of a chair being that you can **sit on the chair**. Not that there are hidden affordances to every object that can be temporary and dependant on the user. Such affordances being that the chair can be used to **stand on to reach high places** or that the chair can be **easily lifted for portability**.

*What I learned:* That there is a difference between the intended purpose of an object, and how to achieve said intended purpose. I thought that both of these branches of information were considered **affordances**, and while designers may feel comfortable still using the term **affordances** for both the intention and achieveability of a purpose, a better term for actively instructing a user, whether this be via tutorial, instruction manual, or an arrow and description, is the word **signifier**. Sometimes, **signifiers** can be the opposite of the original intention, or an accident created by a third-party.

*What I would like to know more about:* While this chapter talks about the need to make clear your design intention when considering the affordances and signifiers of the product, and how some of the pictured objects could have clearer intentions, I feel it would be even more beneficial to note how one can think more openly about the possible miscommunication in their design ideas. How to make sure that your design planning is structured enough to take into account the possible affordances that can make and break their product for certain audiences.

*How this relates to the project I am working on:* With the banana keyboard, it can be easily misconstrued that all is needed is a banana, via the title. Audiences who have a tendency to skim read, even over instructions, may miss the fact that an orange is also needed to carry out the project. In fact, this is a mistake I made. I asked my mother in law to buy bananas during a shopping trip and was ready to begin carrying out my experiment, only to thoroughly read the instructions and realise I also needed an orange. Luckily, I was able to quickly rectify this error. But others might not be as lucky as I. 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before:* before reading this it was easy for me to take microinteractions for granted. Little things like volume buttons and auto-fill on web forms. It is easy to take these things for granted because they're used without much thought. I do not consider what it would be like to not have a certain feature on my phone. This article put into question my beliefs on whether or not a phones capabilities are fully fleshed out for each individual user - for example; should there be a notification on iPhones that when you silence your phones, that your alarms will not also be silenced? Should there be an option to quickly shut off all alarms?

*What I learned:* I learned that a lot of microinteractions are created from trial and error in previous models. Sometimes mistakes have to be made in order to create something that is truly brilliant. Microinteractions come in the form of a website guessing your name based off of your email, or a website telling you the strength of your password. But, despite the name of the term having the word *micro* in it, that doesn't mean it has to be one little thing. A Microinteraction can be big, or even the entire point of a singular product. As long as things aren't over complicated and it is dedicated to a task. Such as a toaster - the entire product has one capability. It toasts. In that way, it is considered a Microinteraction. 

*What I would like to know more about:* I want to know whether it is possible for a Microinteraction to become something that is so much bigger and better. When do we accept that maybe, a Microinteraction is no longer a microinteraction, instead of being a microinteraction with a plethora of affordances?

*How this relates to the project I am working on:* The banana keyboard would be considered a product that in itself is a Microinteraction, due to the matter of it only being useful for one thing - it is made with the purpose to create/make a sound. However, once you remove the Micro:Bit, making the Micro:Bit and Banana Keyboard setup separate entities once more, it is no longer a Microinteraction.

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before:* That the purpose of a prototype is to promote an idea to individuals who may be interested. But a small portion of prototyping is actually about promotion and more about learning about what can be done to improve your project before it does get taken further - whether being taken further means being put on the market, or before the idea becomes accessible for others to use.

*What I learned:* I learned that in experiments, appearance can certainly matter. As the general population might become unsettled by what looks like a bunch of wires strapped to an object, hidden and out of site. They might think it is a bomb. My thought on this part of the article is that if you do not give an accurate appearance to a project, it may be misconstrued as something else and ruin the experience/experiment for yourself, or the user/intended audience.

*What I would like to know more about:* I want to learn more about Arduino. It looks similar to the Micro:Bit in some respects but is obviously a completely different type of product. I would like to learn how to use one, and what they're primarily used for. Another thing I would like to learn how to use is the Raspberry Pi. 

*How this relates to the project I am working on:* while appearance doesn't really come into play with my banana keyboard, if I was to prototype it I would have to disclose that the aluminium foil, in place of crocodile clips, was just a design choice for the early stages of my experiment. As the use of foil is quite juvenile and might make my product be taken a lot less seriously than intended. But then again...it's a banana that makes noises. 


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*
