#### Reflection ####

This was the first experiment in the book that well and truly blew my mind. I found it fun to create and couldn't get over how simple it was to re-create it. The code was basic and the setup was simple, but the results - while they may not seem like a big deal - were pretty awesome. I loved seeing the Microbit respond in real time to the changes in lighting situation with minimal lag. I found one of the challenges of this particular experiment was working with all the inputs being within close proximity of one another, and trying to not get tangled in the cords.

I believe this shows the basic workings of solar panels on outdoor garden lights. They charge via sunlight and then, when the light senses that it's getting dark around, it will turn on to create light. This can also be achieved if you cover the entirety of the solar panel, much how you can trigger the Microbit to show a moon in its LEDS by covering the top of the phototransistor, used in this experiment.
