### USING A LIGHT SENSOR & ANALOG INPUTS ###

The point of this experiment is to get the Micro:bit to recognise lighting over and under 200. When it is over, it will use its LEDs to create an image of the sun, and when it is under 200, it will instead use its LEDs to create an image of the moon.

For this experiment, you need;

x3 Male to Female jumper wires.
x1 Phototransistor.
x1 10K Resistor.

This was the first experiment in the book that well and truly blew my mind. I found it fun to create and couldn't get over how simple it was to re-create it. The code was basic and the setup was simple, but the results - while they may not seem like a big deal - were pretty awesome. I loved seeing the Microbit respond in real time to the changes in lighting situation with minimal lag. I found one of the challenges of this particular experiment was working with all the inputs being within close proximity of one another, and trying to not get tangled in the cords.

I believe this shows the basic workings of solar panels on outdoor garden lights. They charge via sunlight and then, when the light senses that it's getting dark around, it will turn on to create light. This can also be achieved if you cover the entirety of the solar panel, much how you can trigger the Microbit to show a moon in its LEDS by covering the top of the phototransistor, used in this experiment. 

### DIMMING AN LED USING A POTENTIOMETER ###

The point of this experiment is to control the brightness settings of a red 5MM LED on the solderless breadboard. To play with these settings you are using a pententiometer as a dimmer switch. 

For this experiment, you need the following;

x1 Potentiometer.
x1 Push switch.
x1 Red 5MM LED.
x1 47 Resistor.
x7 Male to Female jumper wires.

You can see that gradually the red 5MM LED got brighter as I played with the switch. I fear maybe my battery pack was running out, which resulted in a less obvious lighting difference than I hoped. But there is still a difference, so I decided to document this experiment still.

In this experiment, the first time I did it, the dimming of the light was incredibly noticeable and mind blowing. However, the second time the dimming wasn't crazy apparent, but it still did what the experiment was meant to do. The setup was decently simple considering the amount of wires, and I enjoyed how interactive this particular experiment was, with the dimming switch and the button to power the LED on and off. Having an experiment this interactive in both the creation and final product was a lot of fun, and made the experience more enjoyable. 

### USING A TRANSISTOR TO DRIVE A MOTOR ###

In this experiment, you use a motor to spin a fan around. Slow at first, then speeds up, before stopping for ten seconds and then starting again. 

For this experiment, you need the following;

x1 Transistor.
x1 2.2k Resistor.
x1 Terminal connector.
x1 Motor.
x3 Male to Female jumper wires.
x1 Fan blade.

The following photo shows the movement of the fan. I had to hold the wires to keep them in place inside the terminal connector.

In this experiment I feel like a learned some of the true power and capabilities the Micro:bit has - it's not just something with pretty LED lights, but something that, with the right components, can create things with movement. I really enjoyed this experiment due to using the motor and therefore really wanted to include it in my experiments portfolio. I learned how to create movement with the Micro:bit and how movement doesn't need to be the simplicity of an object moving and not stopping until everything is disconnected. But rather, that a motor, when coded correctly, can follow instruction.

With a bigger fan and bigger motor, this could certainly be used as a typical fan - one to cool the user down. Maybe, if you continue to program the motor to stop every ten seconds, it could stop the user from getting too cold, or even be a more powersavvy option - limiting power consuption and lowering electricity bills. Of course, you could probably run it off a bigger battery, but that seems like a less environmentally conscious option.

### MAKING A GAME USING A COMPASS ###

For this experiment, the aim is to make a mini-game where you try to tilt the Micro:bit and find the secret compass heading that has been randomly selected. The closer you get to it, the red 5MM LED flickering will speed up. When it is at its fastest; it means you have found it. Press A - and you win! If you are wrong, the LEDs in the Micro:bit will display text telling you to "Try Again."

(Pictured, you can see the screen filling as I tilt the device, and eventually the red 5MM LED lit up. At this point, it did not flash quickly, indicating I was nowhere near winning.)

#### Reflection ####

Once again, for this experiment the approach is a little more hands on. But what I liked about it in particular was the interactivity. Yes, you can make a fan movie using a motor, and that's fun - but this actually requires user interaction to get the LEDs to move and respond, and then to get to the secret point in order to get the red 5MM LED to flash rapidly - therefore winning the game.

This experiement uses the basis of a compass like technology that can be used in many video games. The basic concept of this technology can be further applied and built on by using a GPS tracking device to establish the users location, then reward the user based on their location. This has already been applied to mobile phone games such as Pokemon Go, Wizard Unite and Minecraft Earth.

### SETTING THE TONE WITH A PIEZO BUZZER ###

The point of this experiment is to allow the user to create sound with the Micro:bit. The website where you code the Micro:bit has a lot of tones available for the user to install onto the Micro:bit. The way to get the sound to work is either by using the buzzer, in the case of this experiment, or by connecting wired headphones or earphones directly to the Micro:bit via Crocodile (Alligator) clips, or aluminium foil.

During this experiment I got to learn how to enable sound elements through the Micro:bit using the buzzer. There are other ways to get sound to work, such as through earphones or headphones, but the buzzer comes with the kit, and comes with the instructions inside the booklet. It allowed me to learn the code needed to get the sound to work, and what sounds could be used.

This experiment reminded me of a doorbell system. It isn't the same as a doorbell system, where you push a button on a separate panel and a sound plays for the people inside the home, to alert them that someone is at the door, but that is what it reminded me of. And I'm sure with some alterations made it could mimic a doorbell system.
